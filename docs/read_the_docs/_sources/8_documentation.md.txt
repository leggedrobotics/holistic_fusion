# Building this Documentation

This documentation uses ReadTheDocs and Sphinx. 

## Dependencies
To build the documentation locally, you need to have Sphinx installed. You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install sphinx
```

Moreover, as we use markdown files, you need to install the `myst_parser` package:

```bash
pip install myst-parser
```

Moreover, to make the documentation look nice, we use the `sphinx_rtd_theme`:

```bash
pip install sphinx_rtd_theme
```
